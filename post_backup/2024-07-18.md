# STL - move semantics
C++11 introduced move semantics, which allows the efficient transfer of resources from one object to another. This is particularly useful for containers, as it allows them to be moved around without the need for expensive deep copies. In this post, we'll explore how move semantics work in C++ and how they can be used to improve the performance of your code.

## Introduction
Move semantics were introduced in C++11 to address the inefficiencies of copying objects. Before C++11, when an object was copied, all of its resources were duplicated, which could be expensive for large objects. Move semantics allow objects to be transferred from one location to another without the need for a deep copy, which can significantly improve performance.

## Rvalue references
Move semantics are based on the concept of rvalue references, which are a new type of reference introduced in C++11. Rvalue references are used to bind to temporary objects, which are objects that are about to be destroyed. By using rvalue references, we can distinguish between lvalues (objects with a name) and rvalues (temporary objects) and perform different operations on them.

```cpp
int x = 42; // x is an lvalue
int y = 123; // y is an lvalue
int z = x + y; // x + y is an rvalue
```
