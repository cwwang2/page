# AI Agentic development

## Introduction
The development of AI agents is a complex process that requires a lot of resources and time. In this article, we will discuss the different stages of AI agentic development and the challenges that developers face.

## Stages of AI Agentic Development
The development of AI agents can be divided into several stages:
- **Problem Definition**: In this stage, developers define the problem that the AI agent will solve. They need to understand the requirements of the problem and the constraints that the agent will operate under.
- **Data Collection**: In this stage, developers collect the data that the AI agent will use to learn and make decisions. The quality and quantity of the data are crucial for the success of the agent.
- **Model Training**: In this stage, developers train the AI model using the collected data. They need to choose the right algorithms and hyperparameters to train the model effectively.
- **Testing and Evaluation**: In this stage, developers test the AI agent on different datasets and evaluate its performance. They need to ensure that the agent performs well in different scenarios.
- **Deployment**: In this stage, developers deploy the AI agent in the real world. They need to monitor the agent's performance and make improvements if necessary.
- **Maintenance**: In this stage, developers maintain the AI agent and update it with new data and algorithms. They need to ensure that the agent continues to perform well over time.
